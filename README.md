# rna-seq-tutorial-local-run
This is a tutorial for running RNA-seq analysis locally on a personal machine (laptop / desktop) based on existing tutorials.
The purpose is to provide a more clear tutorial for beginners that I can share with students as some of the existing tutorials have presumed knowledge and even errors.

The original code and datasets chosen are from the scienceparkstudy group's github page for a Data Carpentry tutorial for RNA-seq which is in a pre-alpha state. (https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/)
