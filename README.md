# rna-seq-tutorial-local-run
This is a tutorial for running RNA-seq analysis locally on a personal machine (laptop / desktop) based on existing tutorials.
The purpose is to provide a more clear tutorial for beginners that I can share with students as some of the existing tutorials have presumed knowledge and even errors.
